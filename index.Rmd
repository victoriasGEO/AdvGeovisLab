# Hello!

I am Victoria and welcome to my personal site. This homepage is written in **R Markdown** and will be published on **GitHub Pages**.

- I am interested in: geospatial data science, ecological restoration, and public lands. 
- This site will grow as I add more `.Rmd` analyses under **Analyses**.
